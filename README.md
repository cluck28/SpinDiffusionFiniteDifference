# SpinDiffusionFiniteDifference
A simple finite difference simulation to calculate the time evolution of the vector magnetization undergoing transverse spin diffusion

Files to generate the vector magnetization, to plot the x,y,z projections, and to project as happens in the experiment for imaging. Text files are time series for different initialization pulses.

Last upload is recent data with finite pulses. Fitting was done in Mathematica (for fast use of special functions)
