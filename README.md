# SpinDiffusionFiniteDifference
A simple finite difference simulation to calculate the time evolution of the vector magnetization undergoing transverse spin diffusion

Files to generate the vector magnetization, to plot the x,y,z projections, and to project as happens in the experiment for imaging.

Last upload is recent data with finite pulses
